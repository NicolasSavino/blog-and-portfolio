I’m approaching my last few days being a teenager. I’ve started getting lower back pain, my reflexes aren’t as sharp, and it takes me quite a bit of time to get out of bed.

Everyone always says “I wish I were older” when they’re young, but I was quite the opposite. From a young age, I always liked being young, and each year for me was a reminder that I was coming closer to my end.

My limbs lengthened, my hair grew longer (thank God I haven’t lost it yet), and the mark on the wall increased.

My shoe size always coordinated with the year of school I was in, same with the calendar year.

2011 meant first grade, 2012 meant second grade, and so on and so forth.

Numbers, symbols, and signs always stuck out to me.

I remember specifically in sixth grade my science teacher told us that our brain stops developing when we hit 25.

25 meant the decline of our brain cells, and would lead to our eventual death.

And so, I often wished that a year wouldn’t go by, because when I hit 25, that meant I was dying.
Death never scared me, but the idea of getting older did.

When you’ve been around as long as I am, you think you know everything about the world.

People ten years my senior say that I’m lucky to be young, and people ten years younger than me look at me like I have it all figured out.

I don’t think age leads to wisdom, so I’m not going to go along with that trope.

Wisdom comes from experience, from learning, and from growth.

## Transformative Times

Most people tend to believe that the most transformative years in life comes from ages 20-30. It’s the age you graduate college, maybe find a partner, and situate yourself in life.

Maybe not in today’s digital age, but these milestones are often an indicator of “success.”

I disagree with this sentiment. I’d say the ages of 13-19 are the most transformative in one’s life.

First of all, there’s the obvious physical change, but there’s also a mental change.

The desire to fit in, be yourself, and find yourself arise from the moment you’re handed a diploma in middle school.

It’s kind of a preview of the real world.

When you think about it, high school functions a lot like an office.

As Juice WRLD says, “there’s still gossip, there’s still drama, there’s a right and there’s a wrong. There’s still people that I don’t think will love me till I’m gone.”

Pretty accurate if I had to say.

Workplaces, especially in the corporate world are filled with the idea of “stairs.”

My professor told me this expression, “people are like stairs, the ones you see coming down might be the ones you see coming up.”

The corporate world is a stepping stone. It’s an idealized concept of growth, but what is that growth? It’s financial aspirations.

There’s workplace drama, there’s liars, and there’s scammers.

Majority of businesses nowadays begin on the idea of a lie.

Majority of companies are formed with an idealized version of themselves.

Don’t believe me? Look into the AI world. It’s filled with overpromising and underdelivering.

It’s like when a company tells you “we’re like a family.”

If you hear that at a job interview, I got a plan for you, run away as fast as you can.

It’s the same thing during these years.

We want to fit in to the social norm, so we dress a little differently, eat with a different hand, sag our pants a little, or talk in code around others.

It could be the opposite too. You could intentionally be different and spend your time doing the opposite of what everyone does.

The idea however, still stands. Conformity and non-conformity both share the idea of adaptation.

Getting back to my main point of this segment, the ages of 13-19 are filled with “world experience.”

It’s a precursor to what you’re 20’s are going to be like.

Think about it like this: It is a well-known fact that Easter is the most important holiday on the liturgical calendar.

It’s when Christ died to save us from sin and showed us it through His Resurrection.

I often think that Christmas is more important. Without the Birth of Christ, Easter would never have existed. 

There needed to be a beginning to form the end. 

Maybe I’m getting too philosophical, but it makes it clear for me.

You learn social cues, verbal cues, body language, and if you’re an overthinker like myself, you learn a heck of a lot about rumination and anxiety.

Your teenage years can kind of feel like limbo. Almost as if you are waiting to be done with high school or whatever it may be in order to progress further in life.

In class I wouldn’t really pay attention to the material. Sorry to my Professors especially, but as I’ve gotten older, I’ve learned to teach myself.

Countless times I’ve had the idea of just walking out of class and dropping out, but we still thug it out for now.

## We’re only getting older baby

Like I said, I don’t like birthdays. I don’t like celebrations of myself.

There’s no point. Congratulations for surviving another year? Well, that’s too pessimistic.

I really enjoy celebrating others. I like celebrating their milestones, their accomplishments, but for myself, eh, it doesn’t matter much to me. 

I like the joy of being a kid. I’m an adult, but I’m not an adult adult.

Maybe by the time you see this I’ll be an unc. Start bringing the wheelchair for me.

Maybe it’s the glorification of birthdays that gets me going the most.

Turning the twenty is supposed to be entering the best years of my life, but the day before and the day after my birthday feels the same.

More often than not, I think it’s the state of life you’re in rather than the age that plays the bigger role in development.

I look back at my eighteen year old self and realize that he was thinking years into the future. 

Now, that’s just emphasized even more as I age.

The age I’ll buy a home, the age I’ll marry, have kids, or do whatever life asks of me.

It’s almost as if you’re waiting for all of these things to happen, like life will just swoop you off your feet.

You ever stop and think, “Why?”

Getting older for me is a reminder of what I have left to do. It’s a reminder that I still haven’t achieved my dreams and I need to work harder.

It’s a reminder of the stoics and their famous memento mori.

I’ll surely remember that I will perish one day.

The truth is, death is always imminent. We don’t actually know when it will come.

You could not wake up tomorrow.

But still, you have today to do it.

So every moment I spent in rumination, every short I scroll through, and every wasted opportunity is a reminder that time is not in my favor.

Unless, I make it to be.

Little by little, I’ve grown to appreciate birthdays.

I use it as a reminder that my dreams still exist and I’m still working towards it.

Although I may have no achieved it in the timeframe I would’ve liked, I at least wake up with a goal in mind.

I wake up slightly earlier than the day before, I mediate for a couple more minutes, and spend less time on my phone.

Little by little, I’m cutting away the foundation that once held me trapped.

When you think about it, greatness comes in all shapes and sizes. 

Colonel Sanders didn’t make KFC until he was 62, Ronald Reagan became president at 69, which doesn’t seem too old nowadays cough cough, and there are plenty of stories just like these.

I’m not saying I want to be successful later in life, but I do know things take time.

So I can look at a birthday as a reminder of death and time remaining, or, I can look at it as dang I’m lucky to have two arms and two legs at my age.

Glass half empty, Glass half full.

Still, I need to do more.

## What’s Next Unc?

Well, I’m delving into the 20’s. People say it’s the golden times of your youth, but hey, every day is a battle for me.

I don’t care that it will never end, because I wake up everyday wanting to push myself further and change myself.

I don’t always do it, but I’m glad to have that feeling.

Turning twenty won’t make me feel any more significant, but it will remind me to hone in on what I hold true to my heart.

It’s a reminder to keep going, and to push even more.

I don’t have the “I’m a kid” card anymore. I’m a grown adult with a childlike wonder of life.

I guess I’ve always been mature for my age.

All this self-righteous talk and I’m only 20.

Well, thanks for being here.

Do Good. Be Good. God Bless.
